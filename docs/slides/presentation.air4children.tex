\section{Why? What? How?}



\subsection{}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{
\begin{frame}{WHY? Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (AIR)}

Why AIR is important for children and community of Xicohtzinco?

* Aware children and parents on the use and applications of AIR \\ 
* Create a community where children can freely take AIR  \\   
* Then such group will help their community proposing solutions with AIR    \\

\subsection{}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{
\begin{frame}{WHAT?}

* Build Mexican OpenSource Robots which are:
\begin{itemize}
        \item Affordable, 
	\item Educational, and 
	\item Fun!
\end{itemize}

* Create an inclusive community where children and persons of any age can
learn and share knowledge of Artificial Intelligence and
Robotics for free!

* Create a self-sustainable community where
members will make their best to help 
children and others finding their potential 
through the use of AI and Robotics!

}



\subsection{}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{
\begin{frame}{WHO? and HOW?}

* People who want to change the future of Mexico \\  
* Finding founders for AIR   \\
* Create a solid and robust project \\
* Create the vision of AIR with short and long term plans \\
%for for one, two, five and ten years
%* Create short and long term impact in the community   \\

\subsection{}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{
\begin{frame}{Aim of AIR4Children}

%* Nearly 2 out of 10 children have access to fundamentals of robotics,
The aim of AIR4Children is to create a community for not only in the area of robotics 
but also in artificial intelligence 
where anyone can freely learn and share knowledge.
