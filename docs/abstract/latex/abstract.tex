% Why your idea is innovate?
Deep Learning (DL) is a branch of machine learning in Artificial Intelligence
which essentially takes advantage of a huge datasets to train neural networks.
Then the algorithms developed in DL are, for instance, applied in self-driving cars,
games to play go against top players or in face emotion recognition to mention but 
a few. 
The great impact of DL in recent years is also because of improvements in 
hardware development and mainly because of open source tools and libraries \cite{matelabs2017}.
Additionally to that, there is a huge range of applications in areas such as robotics,
transportation, medicine and last but not least in education.
With this in mind, we propose to use a raspberry pi, a $\pounds$30 board with
GNU/Linux OS, connected with a mini arduino board, $\pounds$2 board,  servomotors 
and pi camera in order to create a simple low-cost educational robot 
where children can learn the basics concepts of deep learning  \cite{durr2015}.
Our general aim with the education robot is to perform some examples of 
convolutional neural networks to recognise six basic emotions:
happy, sad, surprise, fear, anger and neutral \cite{ho2016, Ruiz-Garcia2016}
in order to control the robot. For which, thought many didactic activities 
children can interact with the robot and learn concepts of robotics, linear algebra, 
machine learning, and deep learning.

% In which are your idea will make an impact?
We believe that teaching deep learning with low-cost robots can create
both economical and pedagogical impact and children will be persuaded to work
towards the creation of better living conditions to anyone, anywhere in the world.
